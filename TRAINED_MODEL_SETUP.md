# 🎯 Trained CLIP Model Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Download Your Trained Model from Colab

In your Colab notebook, **after training completes**, run this cell:

```python
# Download the trained model files
from google.colab import files
import zipfile
import os

# Create a zip file of the trained model
os.system('zip -r fine_tuned_clip.zip fine_tuned_clip/')

# Download the zip file
files.download('fine_tuned_clip.zip')
```

**Save the downloaded `fine_tuned_clip.zip` to your Downloads folder.**

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

```bash
cd backend
python setup_trained_model.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Extract your trained model
- ✅ Update the code to use your model
- ✅ Create a test script

### Step 3: Test Your Trained Model

```bash
python test_trained_model.py
```

## 🔄 Switching Between Models

**Use your trained model:**
```bash
python switch_clip_model.py trained
```

**Switch back to original:**
```bash
python switch_clip_model.py original
```

## 🚀 What Happens Next

1. **Your trained model** will be saved to `../models/fine_tuned_clip/`
2. **The code will automatically use** your trained model for embeddings
3. **Better similarity search** - your model understands nail art better
4. **No API changes needed** - everything works the same

## 🧪 Testing Your Model

The test script will:
- ✅ Load your trained model
- ✅ Generate an embedding from a test image
- ✅ Verify the model is working correctly

## 🎉 Expected Results

With your trained model, you should see:
- **Better similarity matching** for nail art
- **More accurate search results**
- **Improved understanding** of nail art specific features

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading
- ✅ Check that `fine_tuned_clip.zip` is in your Downloads folder
- ✅ Ensure the zip file contains the model files
- ✅ Verify the model is compatible with CLIP architecture

### Test Fails
- ✅ Check that your model files are complete
- ✅ Verify the model was trained correctly
- ✅ Check for any error messages in the output

## 📁 File Structure After Setup

```
models/
└── fine_tuned_clip/
    ├── config.json
    ├── pytorch_model.bin
    ├── tokenizer.json
    ├── tokenizer_config.json
    └── training_history.json
```

## 🎯 Ready to Go!

Once setup is complete:
1. **Your trained model** will be integrated
2. **Better search results** will be available
3. **No code changes** needed for your API
4. **Deploy as usual** - Railway will use your trained model

Your nail art search will now use your custom-trained CLIP model! 🎨✨
