## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Search Still Fails:**
1. Check Railway backend is running: `curl https://nail-art-search-production.up.railway.app/`
2. Check backend logs in Railway dashboard
3. Verify environment variables are set in Railway
4. Test local backend works: `cd backend && poetry run python start_pinecone_only.py`

### **If Fake Vendors Still Appear:**
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if Railway backend was redeployed with latest code
4. Verify API calls are going to correct backend URL

### **If Images Are Duplicated:**
1. Check browser console for "🎯 Best unique result" logs
2. Verify frontend received multiple different images from backend
3. Test with different search queries
