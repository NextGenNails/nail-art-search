# 🚀 Railway Model Upload Instructions

## Current Status
✅ **Code deployed successfully** - Your trained CLIP integration is live on Railway  
⏳ **Model files needed** - Upload your trained model files to complete the setup

## 📁 Model Files Required
You need to upload these files to Railway:
- `models/config.json`
- `models/merges.txt` 
- `models/model.safetensors` (1.6GB - the main model file)
- `models/preprocessor_config.json`
- `models/training_history.json`
- `models/vocab.json`

## 🎯 Upload Methods

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Find your `nail-art-search` backend service
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Go to the **Files** tab
5. Upload your `models/` folder or create a zip file
6. Extract it in the root directory (`/app/models/`)
7. **Redeploy** your service

### Method 2: Railway CLI
1. Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
2. Login: `railway login`
3. Link project: `railway link`
4. Upload: `railway up models/`

### Method 3: Create Model Zip
If you have the model files locally:
```bash
# Create a zip file
zip -r trained_model.zip models/

# Upload via Railway dashboard or CLI
```

## 🔧 Current Behavior
- **Without model files**: App will use the original CLIP model (fallback)
- **With model files**: App will use your trained CLIP model (improved search)

## ✅ Verification
After uploading, check your Railway logs to see:
- `✅ Loaded trained CLIP model from /app/models` (success)
- `🔄 Falling back to original CLIP model...` (if files missing)

## 🎉 Expected Results
Once model files are uploaded, you'll have:
- **Improved search accuracy** with your trained model
- **738 nail art images** in your database
- **Enhanced similarity matching** for nail art queries
